### Installing this project

The install script for this project is Debian based and designed to run on a 64 bit Ubuntu 12.04 machine. *If you do not have 64 bit hardware the install script will not work for you* and you will have to do a manual build. It is best if you do not already have postgres installed on your machine.

To install this project, first fork this repo onto your own github account and clone it into your preferred source directory. We recommend checking out the latest tagged release, but if you want to just checkout the lastest code you can skip this next step. Find and checkout the latest tag with the following:

    git remote add XTUPLE git://github.com/xtuple/xtuple.git
    git fetch XTUPLE
    git checkout `git describe --abbrev=0`

Then run:

    cd scripts
    sudo ./install_xtuple.sh

This will take a while. Then, to start the datasource, run

    cd ../node-datasource
    sudo ./main.js

Launch your local browser and navigate to the address `localhost`. Default username and password are `admin`.
